# Unit 20 React: React Portfolio

Now that you've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, you'll be updating your portfolio and other materials to build toward being employer competitive. Creating a portfolio using React will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.


* Updated portfolio featuring 6 total projects

* Use React

* A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages

* A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page 

* Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router

* A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages

* Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring those same projects


### Updated Portfolio

Your updated site should still have all of the content it previously had:

* Your name

* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number

* A link to a PDF of your resume with updated projects

* A list of projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:

  * Project title

  * Link to the deployed version

  * Link to the GitHub repository

  * GIF or screenshot of the deployed application


#### Design

As with the previous portfolio homework, "good" design is subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design


* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.


* A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page 

* Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router
